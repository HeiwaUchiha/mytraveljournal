The sun had barely risen when I left my guesthouse in Benin City. The streets were just beginning to stir, and the red earth — so rich, so alive — glowed softly beneath my feet. Today wasn't just another day in the ancient city; today, I was going to visit the Palace of the Oba of Benin, the living heart of a kingdom that had withstood time, war, and colonial arrogance.

I had always been fascinated by the Benin Kingdom — not the one found in schoolbooks, reduced to a few paragraphs, but the real one: proud, mystical, elegant, and enduring. I grew up hearing stories of Oba Ewuare, of bronze casters, of warriors who fought not just with spears but with spirit. And now, as I approached Ring Road, the cultural and commercial nerve of the city, I could feel those stories coming alive.

A local guide, Ogie, met me by King’s Square. “You must not wear black,” he reminded me gently. “It is a color of mourning. The Oba’s palace is a place of life.” I nodded, adjusting my white linen shirt, the color chosen deliberately — purity, respect, light.

The gates of the palace loomed ahead — tall, austere, yet intricately designed. Red walls stood firm like ancient sentinels. Before entering, I had to bow — not as a tourist, but as a humble guest. The Royal Palace of the Oba of Benin, a UNESCO World Heritage site and sacred cultural treasure, is not just a building. It is a living symbol of divine kingship, the ancestral spirit of a people still very much connected to their past.

As we passed through the main gate, the world outside seemed to fade. The sound of horns, street sellers, and keke drivers gave way to the gentle rhythm of footsteps on ancient stone. I was in another world.

Inside, the palace was a labyrinth of red clay courtyards, shrines, and corridors adorned with symbolic carvings. Ivories, bronzes, and ancestral plaques whispered secrets to those who could listen. My guide told me each piece was more than art — they were records, stories frozen in metal and stone. The famous Benin Bronzes that once stood here now lived in European museums, looted during the 1897 British invasion. But even in their absence, the palace pulsed with power.

In a shaded courtyard, we met one of the Iwebo chiefs, dressed in regal coral beads and a white wrapper that shimmered in the morning light. He spoke in Edo, and though I couldn’t understand much, his tone was clear: respectful, proud, firm. Ogie translated: “He says, welcome. The spirit of the ancestors watches over you.”

A hush fell as the Oba’s herald emerged from one of the chambers. “The Oba is aware of your presence,” he said. “But you must not speak unless spoken to. And you must not raise your eyes above the level of his chest.”

I felt my heart hammer in my chest. The Oba of Benin — not just a king, but a sacred institution, believed to be the bridge between the mortal world and the ancestors — was near.

When Oba Ewuare II entered, the atmosphere shifted. He didn’t walk. He glided. His robe was heavy with coral beads, his crown tall and glimmering like the morning star. And yet, his presence was not oppressive. It was calm. Regal. Eternal.

He said few words. But when he looked at me, I felt like I was being weighed by history itself. His voice was soft but commanding. “You come not just to see, but to understand,” he said. “Then you must listen. Not just with ears, but with spirit.”

After a brief nod, he exited as silently as he came, leaving behind a silence so deep it hummed.

We moved to the royal ancestral altars, where Ogie explained how each Oba was honored after death — not as a memory, but as a spirit still active in the affairs of the kingdom. Offerings of kola nut, white chalk, and palm oil lay before the altars.

Hours passed, but it felt like minutes. I met bronze casters from the Igun Street Guild, priests of the Ebo Festival, and dancers who performed the Ikharo steps with movements so precise they seemed guided by invisible strings. I touched no walls, took no photographs — not out of fear, but reverence.

By the time we exited the palace, the sun had dipped low in the sky, painting everything in a golden glow. I turned back one last time, hoping to imprint the image into my mind.

Ogie smiled beside me. “You have seen more than most people ever do,” he said. “But what matters now is what you carry with you.”

And carry it I did — not just the memory of architecture or tradition, but the lingering sense that I had walked through a gate in time and stood where gods once stood. That I had looked into the eyes of royalty not as a spectacle, but as a believer.

As I made my way back into the modern bustle of Benin City, I felt different. Not bigger, but smaller — humbled by the depth of a culture that refused to fade.

The Palace of the Oba of Benin wasn’t just a destination.

It was a revelation.
